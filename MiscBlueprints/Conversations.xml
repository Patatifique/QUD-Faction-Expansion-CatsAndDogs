				Sheer inability from a dog to accept anything but a leader's throne. Before my grandmother's grandmother, this place was called Shikspar, the first wall erected by the Founder themselves. When they passed away, their first child naturally took over -- and years later, my line still guides our people.
				
				A few farmers came up with the outlandish claim our Founder had appointed one of them as leader of Shikspar, and when we refused their outrageous terms, they opted for robbing us of half the village name. So stands "Spar" as the Founder intended.
